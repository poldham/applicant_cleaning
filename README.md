Utilities for cleaning patent applicant names from two sources:

- USPTO PatentsView Disambiguated assignee names and raw assignee names as a dictionary
- EUROSTAT 2006 Data Production Methods for Harmonised Patent Statistics: Patentee Name Harmonisation. Appendix 2 on search and replace statements for legal forms

Note that the use of these tools is presently experimental and you may prefer to use the PATSTAT
disambiguation table if you come across this repo.
